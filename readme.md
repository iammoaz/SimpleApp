# Simple App
A single screen app build using RxSwift and MVVM that displays 2 pieces of information, a counter for the number of times data has been fetched, the current UUID response code that was fetched, and a button that can be pressed to fetch new content, along with Unit tests for the core functionality.

To run the example app:
* Run the backend server by running "python server.py". This will make the server available on http://localhost:8000.
* Open `Rx.xcworkspace` and hit `Run`.
